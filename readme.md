## Experiments

During weeks 9 and 10, I explored into the realm of machine learning and experimented with three different models. 
To begin, I utilized Teachable Machines to develop a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against an AI opponent that never loses due to its ability to rapidly calculate my hand movements. An attachment to the p5.js implementation is available here.

Additionally, I explored ml5js and utilized hand gestures to create and manipulate particles for drawing images with my index finger. Furthermore, I incorporated additional functionalities, such as changing the particle color by placing my pinky and thumb together and erasing the drawing by creating a fist gesture.

Lasty,  I explored Face Api in ml5js, which involved feeding an image of a face to the AI, which then drew lines to identify various facial features, such as eyebrows and eyes. An attachment to the p5.js implementation for this project is available here.
