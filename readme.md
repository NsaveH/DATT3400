## Experiments

During weeks 9 and 10, I explored into the realm of machine learning and experimented with three different models. 

To begin, I utilized Teachable Machines to develop a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against an AI opponent that never loses due to its ability to rapidly calculate my hand movements. 


Additionally, I explored ml5js and utilized hand gestures to create and manipulate particles for drawing images with my index finger. Furthermore, I incorporated additional functionalities, such as changing the particle color by placing my pinky and thumb together and erasing the drawing by creating a fist gesture.

Lasty,  I explored Face Api in ml5js, which involved feeding an image of a face to the AI, which then drew lines to identify various facial features, such as eyebrows and eyes.
